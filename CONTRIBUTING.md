***CONTRIBUTING TO SPIRITLESS

Hey guys, anyone is allowed to contribute we just ask that you tell us what is wrong so we can look into it, unfortunatly due to the fact we are looking at console support we cannot make the game open source. BUT FEAR NOT!!! We do hope you guys will still help us out by Donating and sending us bug reports, due to a rushed schedule we expect there to be a few bug that slip our grip.

** How to file a bug report?

Step 1 - Click on the "Issues" tab
Step 2 - Click the "New Issue" button
Step 3 - Click the button that says "Get Started"
Step 4 - Create a title
Step 5 - Follow the template provided to make a bug report
Step 6 - (If applicable) add screenshots or screen recordings, every bit helps
Step 7 - Click "Submit Issue"
Step 8 - That's it! You are done filing a report! Keep watch on the report though, we will make sure you know what's going on. If we do not start working on the issue within the week it is likely we forgot so shoot the head developer an email at zclark145@gmail.com.

** How in the heck do I donate?

Fun fact... we keep asking for donations but haven't actually made a donation system (heh) but keep watch because it is in the works and will be around soon.
